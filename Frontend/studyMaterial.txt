MERN folder structure with rtk -----


Below is a folder structure for a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project with Redux Toolkit (RTK) integrated:

project-root/
├── client/               # Frontend folder
│   ├── public/
│   │   └── index.html    # HTML template
│   ├── src/

│   │   │   └── store.js  # Redux store configuration

Explanation of each folder and file:

client/: Contains the frontend code written in React.js.

public/: Contains the HTML template (index.html) where the React app is mounted.
src/: Contains the source code for the React app.
assets/: Contains static assets such as images, fonts, etc.
components/: Contains reusable UI components used across the app.
pages/: Contains React components for each page of the app.
store/: Contains Redux store setup.
slices/: Contains Redux slices, which include reducers and actions managed by Redux Toolkit.
store.js: Configures and exports the Redux store.
App.js: Main React component where routes and global UI components are defined.
index.js: Entry point for the React app, where it is mounted onto the HTML template.
package.json: Contains frontend dependencies and scripts.
server/: Contains the backend code written in Node.js and Express.js.

config/: Contains configuration files, such as database configuration.
controllers/: Contains request handlers (controllers) for different routes.
models/: Contains Mongoose models for MongoDB.
routes/: Contains Express routes for different API endpoints.
middleware/: Contains custom middleware functions.
app.js: Sets up the Express application, including middleware and routes.
server.js: Entry point for the Node.js server.
.env: Environment variables file.

package.json: Contains backend dependencies and scripts.

This folder structure separates frontend and backend code, making it easier to manage and scale the project. Redux Toolkit (RTK) is integrated into the frontend for state management, providing a centralized store with Redux slices for managing application state.
